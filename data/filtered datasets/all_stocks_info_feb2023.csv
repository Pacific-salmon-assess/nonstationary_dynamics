Hatchery component of the run was removed by subtracting hatchery salmon post season and assuming age composition matches that of hatchery fish; upper and lower river values combined because runs not identified in harvests. With wild vs. hatchery, and delta vs. upriver components, the Copper River can get really complicated. Also, the Miles Lake sonar cannot distinguish between various species. Thus, Chinook salmon are subtracted from the sonar counts post-season, as are estimates of fish harvest upriver in personal use and subsistence fisheries."
