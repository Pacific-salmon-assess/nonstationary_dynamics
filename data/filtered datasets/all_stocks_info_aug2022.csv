With wild vs. hatchery, and delta vs. upriver components, the Copper River can get really complicated. Also, the Miles Lake sonar cannot distinguish between various species. Thus, Chinook salmon are subtracted from the sonar counts post-season, as are estimates of fish harvest upriver in personal use and subsistence fisheries."
